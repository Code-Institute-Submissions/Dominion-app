			<p>If you're reading this page, the chances are that you're already familiar with the <a href="http://riograndegames.com/games.html?id=278" target="_blank">Dominion</a> card game. If by some chance you're not, allow me to briefly explain (for much more information, see the <a href="/links">links</a> page):</p>
			<p>Dominion is one of the most popular tabletop games to have come out in the past decade, being popular with both hardcore "gamers" (like me) and with more casual groups who prefer lighter family games like <a href="http://www.catan.com/game/catan" target="_blank">Catan</a> or <a href="https://www.daysofwonder.com/tickettoride/en/" target="_blank">Ticket to Ride</a>. It won the prestigious German <a href="http://www.spiel-des-jahres.com/en" target="_blank">Spiel des Jahres</a> award in 2008 (almost always awarded to "family-friendly" games with relatively simple rules) - yet it has considerable depth of strategy. What is most impressive about Dominion, and has become more so with every expansion released (10 to date, plus promos and second editions of the base set and first expansion, with new cards in each), is the sheer variety of different setups. With the choice of only 10 "Kingdom Card" sets from nearly 300 available, each player is forced to think differently each game about how best to combine the available cards into a deck of their own, one which will get the most Victory points in the shortest time.</p>

			<p>With all this variety, it's fair to say that Dominion isn't just a single game. Even the base set alone (26 Kingdon cards in the second edition) contains over <strong>5 million</strong> different games in one box. Sure, that exaggerates things a fair bit when a lot of these sets will play somewhat the same. But, with the total number of different game setups increasing exponentially with every set of cards added, and each expansion adding special features of its own, by the time you have even 3 or 4 sets, you have more than enough variety to last a lifetime. I suppose it takes a true addict, like me, to have all 11 - but there are many of us out there. Dominion is just that addictive. Did I mention that each game typically only takes about 20 minutes?</p>

			<h3 class="home">But all this variety can lead to confusion...</h3>
			<p>With so many different cards in the game now, it can be hard for even addicts to keep up with everything. Now, this probably doesn't matter in an actual game - you only need to study the cards that are dealt out for that particular game, and not worry about any of the others. But for those who like to think about strategy, and when would be a good time to use a particular card, it can be annoying to not have every card and its details at your fingertips. Suppose you really like villages which also provide you with coins, and you want to know just how many there are in the game. Or you want to know how many trashers there are that cost less than <img src="images/5coins.png" alt="5 coins" />? Well, now you can, really easily. You can also really easily browse through the cards in any expansions you may not have seen yet, and see what is in that set and whether you want it.</p>

			<p>Of course, there are other places you can go to look at all Dominion cards, such as <a href="http://dominion.diehrstraits.com/" target="_blank">this one</a>. The latter even allows you to search the cards by name. But, as far as I know, this is the first site to contain a database of all cards which is searchable by other criteria. I hope you enjoy it. If you have any suggestions as to how to make the site better, please use the <a href="/contact">contact form</a> provided.</p>
			<p>I have included a separate page for each individual card, with all that card's details and a brief few words of my own strategy advice (drawn partly from experience but mainly from badly-digested things I've read on Dominion Strategy) - as well as a link to a much fuller discussion on the <a href="http://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank">Dominion Strategy wiki</a>. I make no apologies for linking to that site extensively - it's awesome.</p>
