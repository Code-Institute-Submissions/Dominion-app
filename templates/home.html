			<p>If you're reading this page, the chances are that you are already familiar with the <a href="http://riograndegames.com/games.html?id=278" target="_blank">Dominion</a> card game. If by some chance you're not, allow me to say a few words (for much more information, see the <a href="/links">links</a> page).</p>
			<p>Dominion is a card game which started an entirely new genre - that of the "deck-building game". The idea is that each player starts with a small and pretty weak deck of cards, which they add new cards to during the game, trying to find the most effective combination of cards in order to come out ahead. In Dominion, the winner is the player with the most "Victory Points" (<img src="images/VP.png" />, abbreviated to VPs) at the end of the game. Victory points are most commonly obtained by obtaining particular cards, which typically have little to no utility in your deck during the game, but are what you need to have in order to win.</p>

			<p>A large part of the reason why Dominion is so outstanding is that it isn't really just one game. You're not choosing from every possible card when adding cards to your deck - just those which are available in the game. Aside from a few "basic" cards which are available in every game, that means the 10 Kingdom cards which have been selected (usually at random) from the cards available in whichever sets the players have access to. With approximately 300 different Kingdom cards available across all sets, that is a truly astronomical number. And the biggest challenge of Dominion is to assess, at the start of the game, what is the best way to construct a deck, from the components available, to get the most VPs you can, and as quickly as you can.</p>

			<h3>But all this variety can lead to confusion</h3>
			<p>With 11 different sets, as well as a handful of promo cards, the variety now available in the game of Dominion is incredible. But this can make it hard to think about the game sensibly. There are a few different sites on the web which list all Dominion cards, with images. <a href="http://dominion.diehrstraits.com/" target="_blank">This one</a> even lets you search them by name. But, in the interests of those who are curious about the variety that the game has to offer, and who perhaps aren't familiar with all the sets - or of those who know all the cards but want to quickly find cards with certain features in order to dream up an amazing combo - this site goes much further. The <a href="/search">search page</a> allows cards to be filtered by any combination of card name, cost, types, sets and card text - and the results to be displayed even as you type. From there, you can click on each individual card for further information - including both my own very brief (and frequently wrong!) reflections on it and a link to the card's page at the brilliant <a href="wiki.dominionstrategy.com/" target="_blank">Dominion Strategy wiki</a></p>.

			 <p>If nothing else, I hope that this site provides entertainment to Dominion addicts like me, who lie awake at night wondering exactly how many cards cost less than <img src="images/4coins.png" alt="4 coins" /> and refer to <a href="/cards/Curse">Curses</a> - or any of a hundred other similar queries. Newer players are also welcome to spend some time here, to glance through all the cards, and perhaps make a decision on which set to buy next.</p>
